# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview
The repository contains four main components:

1. **Google Apps Script** – `onezipp/` holds a set of `.gs` files that build an Upwork industry analysis dashboard in Google Sheets.
2. **n8n workflow** – `upwork-email-classifier.json` defines an n8n flow that pulls Upwork emails from Gmail, classifies them with OpenAI, aggregates results, and outputs rankings.
3. **Vercel deployment** – `vercel.json` rewrites the root URL to `novatech-onboarding-playbook.html` for a static playbook page.
4. **Onezipp Landing Page** – a separate project at `/Users/pratik/Documents/onezipp-landing/` containing a single-page marketing site for the onezipp.com automation agency. See that project's own `CLAUDE.md` for details.

Each component is independent but often used together: the n8n flow can feed data into the Apps Script dashboard, and the playbook page explains the workflow.

## Common Commands
Below are the most useful shell commands you’ll run while developing or maintaining this repo.

| Category | Command | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Apps Script** | `clasp pull` | Pull the latest code from the bound Google Sheet.
| | `clasp push` | Push local `.gs` files to the bound Google Sheet.
| | `clasp open` | Open the script editor in a browser.
| | `clasp status` | Show differences between local and remote.
| | `clasp run <functionName>` | Execute a server‑side Apps Script function (e.g., `clasp run createDashboard`).
| **n8n** | `n8n start` | Start a local n8n instance for debugging.
| | `n8n run <flowId>` | Run a specific flow from the CLI (requires `node` and the `n8n` package).
| | `n8n list` | List available flows and nodes.
| **Vercel** | `vercel dev` | Run a local preview of the static site.
| | `vercel build` | Build the site for deployment.
| | `vercel deploy --prod` | Deploy to production.
| **General** | `npm install` | Install any project‑specific dependencies (currently none, but keep for future expansion).
| | `npm test` | Run any Jest tests if added later.

> **Tip**: The Apps Script functions are identified by the first function in the file that starts with `function`. For example, the entry point for the dashboard is `createDashboard` in `onezipp/create_dashboard.gs`.

## Useful Files & Locations
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `onezipp/create_dashboard.gs` | Builds the main dashboard sheet. Main entry point: `createDashboard`.
| `onezipp/create_upwork_analysis_sheet.gs` | Builds supporting sheets used by the dashboard.
| `onezipp/onezipp-landing.html` | Landing page served via Vercel.
| `upwork-email-classifier.json` | n8n workflow definition.
| `vercel.json` | Route configuration for Vercel.
| `.vercel/project.json` | Vercel project metadata.

## Running the n8n Flow
1. Install n8n locally if you haven’t already: `npm install -g n8n`.
2. Start the editor: `n8n start`.
3. Import `upwork-email-classifier.json` through the web UI or use `n8n import` CLI.
4. Trigger the flow manually or via the Gmail trigger node.

## Deploying the Static Playbook
```bash
vercel dev   # preview locally
vercel build # prepare production build
vercel deploy --prod
```

## Notes for Future Contributors
- If adding new Apps Script files, remember to `clasp push` after editing.
- When modifying the n8n flow, always test locally before deploying to a production environment.
- The `novatech-onboarding-playbook.html` is a simple static page; feel free to enhance it with CSS/JS as needed.
